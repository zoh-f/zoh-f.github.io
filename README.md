Hello! I made this blog to cover topics relating to technology that I found interesting.
So far, I've covered artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and other trends in technology and software. 
I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
I also made the website from scratch in an attempt to teach myself HTML and CSS. However, there are still many things I have left to learn...
