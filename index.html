        <div class = "caption" style="text-align:right;"><em>Artwork made with DALL-E 2</em></div>
        </div>
        <p class = "p2"><a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a>, an AI created by OpenAI, has the capability to generate high quality art using nothing but user-inputted text.
        Impressively, the pictures don't have any of the telltale signs of a typical AI.
        For example, the AI perfectly creates the composition of the images, correctly parsing the context of the user's request.
        There are no objects that awkwardly morph into others, and faces are highly detailed.
        In contrast, the AI <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini">DALL-E mini</a>, which was created entirely separately to fulfill the same purpose, is highly lacking.
        The AI's limitations, such as its inability to create faces, limit its potential for much besides memes and to bring basic ideas to life.
        Still, it demonstrates an important stepping stone for AI, as this technology is advancing rapidly.</p>
        <p class = "p2">One point of contention about OpenAI's DALL-E is the fact that it can be used to create malicious deepfakes of celebrities or other famous people in situations that would jeopardize their reputation.
        Due to its high restrictions, it is only accessible by certain people, preventing its use for these purposes.
        However, it remains to be seen how it will be used by the general public. Most likely, it will continue being used primarily for memes and to test the boundaries of AI.</p>

        <h3 class = "p1">Opinion: Limitations on Software Can Be Beneficial</h3>
        <p class = "p1"><em>July 7th, 2022</em></p>
        <p class = "p2">Anyone who owns a Mac knows the typical story. Maybe you want to download a mod for a video game. Maybe you just want to run a program for school.
        Either way, you know it's going to be a struggle to make sure the program works on your machine. However, this inconvenience comes with a potential benefit:
        optimization. By requiring the program to be made specifically for a certain platform, the creator has to rewrite the program, allowing them to optimize it along the way.
        In addition, the majority of viruses are designed for Windows computers, making it much more difficult for a virus to infect a Mac. The same goes for iPhones. 
        I have personally struggled with helping my grandmother navigate her nearly unusable Android phone, due to viruses that opened the web browser and redirected her to various pages every couple of minutes.
        As such, I was relieved when I found an iPhone that I was able to buy for her, with the knowledge that it was highly unlikely that it would become infected with a virus.
        To top it all off, Apple recently released a new feature: Lockdown Mode. This mode further decreases the risk of security flaws through methods such as restricting unknown calls and limiting iMessage attachments, making it nearly impossible for an iPhone to get a virus.
        However, Apple has stated that this mode is solely to be used by those who need it due to their occupation, such as politicians, journalists, and those in related professions.
        Even without Lockdown Mode, the iPhone's limitations have their drawbacks: for example, they need to be jailbroken to customize the lock screen or to download certain apps. </p>
        <p class = "p2">While these apps can be fun to tinker around with, they ultimately do not bring functionality that is absolutely necessary to the average user.
        In addition, many developers now ensure that their products are available on all platforms, drawn by the appeal of a larger audience enjoying their software.
        This is largely seen by the market share of Apple phones in the United States. Limiting a piece of software to Android would prevent developers from accessing this large demographic.
        It is unlikely that restrictions will begin to ease as viruses become increasingly harder to detect, and companies such as Apple are continuing to make their phones harder to jailbreak with every update.</p>

        <h3 class = "p1">Quantum Technologies and their Potential Impact on Computing</h3>
        <p class = "p1"><em>July 10th, 2022</em></p>
        <p class = "p2">Recently, an <a href="https://newatlas.com/telecommunications/quantum-entanglement-atoms-distance-record/">astonishing feat</a> involving something called quantum entanglement was achieved. 
            In short, quantum entanglement allows for changes in one atom to be immediately reflected in another, regardless of their distance.
            This linkage means that looking at one atom will tell you about the state of the other, hence the name "quantum". Researchers were able to perform quantum entanglement on two atoms twenty miles apart.
            These two atoms were made to emit photons, which were sent through fiber-optic cables. Does that sound like something we know and love today? The article mentions briefly that this feat is "an important step to realizing a quantum internet."
            The implications of this mean that we may someday have instant upload and download speeds, with distance no longer being a factor in internet speeds. Granted, this would be expensive to implement.
            But for data-heavy organizations such as NASA, quantum internet will bring a level of efficiency previous thought to be impossible. As time passes, this technology would undoubtedly become more widespread.
            However, quantum technology is nothing new. Quantum computers have existed for years, with their system of using qubits rather than bits making them exponentially faster than normal computers.
            With quantum internet to potentially go with them, it seems that we may soon be in a new age of technology.
            Most notably, quantum computers with quantum internet together could make completely instantaneous calculations and data transfer possible.
            Unfortunately, quantum technology is very volatile, with any minor changes in conditions potentially altering the state of quantum data, such as qubits.
            As you may know, the way quantum computers work is by using a system of qubits (or quantum bits), rather than the typical bits in a computer. 
            While bits are limited to the states 0 and 1, qubits are able to have states in between, enabling them to transfer much more data than a single bit.
            However, upon checking the state of a qubit, it will automatically jump to a state of 0 or 1, depending on which it is closest to. This makes it difficult to read quantum data despite having it stored.
            We can only hope that advances in technology will allow consumers to take advantage of these developments.
