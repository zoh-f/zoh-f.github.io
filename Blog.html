        <div class = "caption" style="text-align:right;"><em>Artwork made with DALL-E 2</em></div>
        </div>
        <p class = "p2"><a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E 2</a>, an AI created by OpenAI, has the capability to generate high quality art using nothing but user-inputted text.
        Impressively, the pictures don't have any of the telltale signs of a typical AI.
        For example, the AI perfectly creates the composition of the images, correctly parsing the context of the user's request.
        There are no objects that awkwardly morph into others, and faces are highly detailed.
        In contrast, the AI <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini">DALL-E mini</a>, which was created entirely separately to fulfill the same purpose, is highly lacking.
        The AI's limitations, such as its inability to create faces, limit its potential for much besides memes and to bring basic ideas to life.
        Still, it demonstrates an important stepping stone for AI, as this technology is advancing rapidly.</p>
        <p class = "p2">One point of contention about OpenAI's DALL-E is the fact that it can be used to create malicious deepfakes of celebrities or other famous people in situations that would jeopardize their reputation.
        Due to its high restrictions, it is only accessible by certain people, preventing its use for these purposes.
        However, it remains to be seen how it will be used by the general public. Most likely, it will continue being used primarily for memes and to test the boundaries of AI.</p>

        <h3 class = "p1">Opinion: Limitations on Software Can Be Beneficial</h3>
        <p class = "p1"><em>July 7th, 2022</em></p>
        <p class = "p2">Anyone who owns a Mac knows the typical story. Maybe you want to download a mod for a video game. Maybe you just want to run a program for school.
        Either way, you know it's going to be a struggle to make sure the program works on your machine. However, this inconvenience comes with a potential benefit:
        optimization. By requiring the program to be made specifically for a certain platform, the creator has to rewrite the program, allowing them to optimize it along the way.
        In addition, the majority of viruses are designed for Windows computers, making it much more difficult for a virus to infect a Mac. The same goes for iPhones. 
        I have personally struggled with helping my grandmother navigate her nearly unusable Android phone, due to viruses that opened the web browser and redirected her to various pages every couple of minutes.
        As such, I was relieved when I found an iPhone that I was able to buy for her, with the knowledge that it was highly unlikely that it would become infected with a virus.
        To top it all off, Apple recently released a new feature: Lockdown Mode. This mode further decreases the risk of security flaws through methods such as restricting unknown calls and limiting iMessage attachments, making it nearly impossible for an iPhone to get a virus.
        However, Apple has stated that this mode is solely to be used by those who need it due to their occupation, such as politicians, journalists, and those in related professions.
        Even without Lockdown Mode, the iPhone's limitations have their drawbacks: for example, they need to be jailbroken to customize the lock screen or to download certain apps. </p>
        <p class = "p2">While these apps can be fun to tinker around with, they ultimately do not bring functionality that is absolutely necessary to the average user.
        In addition, many developers now ensure that their products are available on all platforms, drawn by the appeal of a larger audience enjoying their software.
        This is largely seen by the market share of Apple phones in the United States. Limiting a piece of software to Android would prevent developers from accessing this large demographic.
        It is unlikely that restrictions will begin to ease as viruses become increasingly harder to detect, and companies such as Apple are continuing to make their phones harder to jailbreak with every update.</p>
